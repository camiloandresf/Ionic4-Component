## How to do this?

Install native plugin.

```
ionic cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-telerik-imagepicker
npm install @ionic-native/image-picker
```
Install cordova gradle support plugin, why because the image picker will stop app due to version difference. The cordova gradle support prevents app stopping.

```
cordova plugin add cordova-android-support-gradle-release
```
